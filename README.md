Chatroom web-app - a journey into the AngularJS framework.

#### Technologies Utilized:
### Firebase, Angular, JavaScript and hosted on Netflify.com

| Primary User goals |
|:---- |
| setting up a username |
| create and/or view publicly available chat rooms |
| create timestamped message threads |
| Users can see a realtime list of all messages pertaining to each chat room |

##### The outcome:
This particular project/assignment was an amazing introduction in building a user-facing real-time message board utilizing AngularJS, a JavaScript framework. Being that Google now owns Firebase and develops Angular it was extremely easy dealing with set-up and maintenance. Having been transitioning from this assignment into Ruby on Rails I can honestly say it was a smooth one. Looking back at this assignment and knowing what I know now (9 months later) I will definitely be revisiting AngularJS even just to geek-around.
